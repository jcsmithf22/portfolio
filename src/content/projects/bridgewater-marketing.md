Bridgewater Marketing Group is a online marketing agency based out of Wisconsin. In July 2024, I was commissioned to build their website.

The basis of the site was the Studio template from TailwindUI. I ported the template to [Laravel](https://laravel.com) and added a small integrated CMS using [Filament](https://filamentphp.com).

Challenges included refactoring the Next.js template to Laravel, and adding strong branding while retaining the clean design.
